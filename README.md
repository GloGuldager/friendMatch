# FriendMatch

#Overview
FriendMatch is a full-stack site that utilizes the results of a 10-question survey to compare answers from submissions to match-up compatible respondents. Once a match is found, the site will display the name and picture of the matched respondent.

#Technologies

npm packages express, path

#How it Works
User enters name and a link to a profile picture, then completes a 10-question survey via an html form. Once the user submits the form, the data is sent to the server and the users scores are compared to other respondents to find the person with the closest matching score. The name and profile pic of the closest matching respondent is returned via the server to the browser via a modal to show the best match for the current user.
